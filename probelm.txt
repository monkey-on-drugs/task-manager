Project: Task Manager with JSON

Objective:
Create a simple task manager that allows the user to add, view, update, and delete tasks. Store the tasks in a JSON file so that the data persists even when the program
is closed.

Features:

    Add a Task: The user can input a task title, description, and due date.
    View Tasks: Display all the tasks in a list format.
    Update a Task: Allow the user to update the task's title, description, or due date.
    Delete a Task: Allow the user to remove a task from the list.
    Persist Data: Store all tasks in a tasks.json file.

Steps to Implement:

    Define a function to load tasks from the JSON file when the program starts. If the file doesn't exist, create an empty list of tasks.
    Define a function to save tasks to the JSON file whenever changes are made (add, update, delete).
    User Interface: Implement a simple command-line interface (CLI) that allows the user to:
        Add a task
        View all tasks
        Update a task by specifying the task number and the new values
        Delete a task by specifying the task number
    Main program loop: Keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.

Why This Project?

    JSON Knowledge: You'll practice loading and saving data in JSON format.
    Python Basics: You'll work with functions, lists, and dictionaries.
    File Handling: You'll get comfortable reading from and writing to files.
    Task Management Logic: You'll create logic for adding, deleting, and updating tasks, which will help you practice coding solutions from scratch.

This project gives you an opportunity to practice many fundamental skills in Python while also helping you learn more about JSON file manipulation.
